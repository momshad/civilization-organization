From the Game <Plague Inc.> we knew, there're only 365 days left before earth civilization ends.

How to make mankind survive from extinction whatever caused by plague or nuclear war or war or any disaster, there're many plans such as seed bank, 2nd earth etc. This project focuses on knowledge part.

This project consists of 4 parts:

1.Knowledge Identification and visualization. We should build a program to identify a youtube video, a film, a novel, an article, a webpage's distinction, content and context. Maybe it's something like patent maps.

2.Knowledge re-org. Re-org for better understanding and better transfer and better development. Everyone could have his/her own version of knowledge while keep the central version clear.

3.Knowledge Preservation. Distribute and keep the copies of the mankind knowledge organized through step 1&2 by different countries and different people. Peer-to-peer file sharing protocols such as BitTorrent will be used. This will break the current IP laws but this is an opportunity to foster a new IP law to make the originals of the knowledge richer.

4.Knowledge Development. After re-org, automated tech such as deep learning and machine learning can help.
